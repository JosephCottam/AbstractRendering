/**Transfer functions converts an aggregate value into another aggregate value, often a color.
 * 
 * Transfer functions are doing analysis and transformation on the discrete values 
 * represented by a set of aggregates.  Since Abstract Rendering is focused on visualization,
 * many transfer functions directly produce colors (and an image is essentially a set of color aggregates).
 * 
 * However, sometimes producing colors immediately is awkward, so transfer functions
 * are generalized to produce any time of aggregate desired.  Multi-stage transfer
 * is logically the same as single stage, by simple function composition.
 * ar.util.combinators.Chain is a utility for achieving that composition.
 * 
 * Transfer functions have a two-phase life cycle: generic and specialized.
 * Often a transfer function needs information about the data it is about
 * to process before it can process the first pixel (such as the bounds on the values).
 * Generic transfers don't know this information yet, specialized ones do.
 * The "Specialize" method converts a generic function into a specialized one
 * OR a specialized one into another one (specialized transfer functions retain the capabilities of generic ones).  
 * The Transfer.Specialized interface
 * indicates that a transfer function is ready for use.

	 * aggregate set.  This method allows the transfer function to compute
	 * relevant relationship quantities once, and then use them multiple times
	 * in the "at" method.
