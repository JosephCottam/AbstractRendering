/**Execute a sequence of transfers.
 * 
 * A transfer function takes a set of aggregates and produces a set of aggregates.
 * In the simple case, the aggregates produced are colors, but they need not be.
 * Chaining to transfers together is simply piping the output of one to the input
 * of the other (conceptually).  This class takes care of that piping.
 * 
 * Specialization cost is includes executing the entire transfer chain for 
 * all points in the specialization aggregates and is paid at specialization time.
 * Therefore, specialization is probably more expensive than in most single-step 
 * or in nested transfers.
 * 
 * Furthermore, the first transfer performed will incur the cost of the whole chain
 * across all aggregates to accommodate locality-aware transfers.
 * 
 * TODO: Can this be done in a type-safe way?
 * 
 * @param <IN> Input type to the first transfer
 * @param <OUT> Output type of the last transfer
