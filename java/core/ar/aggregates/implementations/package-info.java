/**Type-specific implementations of the aggregates interface.
 * These may be instantiated and used directly.  However, the more robust way is to use AggregateUtils.make.
 * 
 * NOTE: These implementations have proven to be beneficial at some time so they are retained.
 * However, it would be great if they could be removed or combined.  The Java Ref/Value divide
 * makes that impossible (for now).
