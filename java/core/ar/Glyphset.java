/**
 * A collection of glyphs for rendering. 
 * A glyph is a geometric description and accompanying data values.
 * 
 * Segmentation
 * ------------
 * 
 * To support parallelization, the glyphset interface supports
 * "segmentation".  This enables sub-setting without the implication of
 * precise divisions.  The basic idea is that a glyphset can report how many
 * divisions it can easily provide, and supports returning a subset of those divisions.
 * The number of divisions is returned by "segments" and the "segment" method
 * returns a subset of those divisions.  
 * 
 * Some parallel processing strategies work best on a subset of the data. The
 * simplest way to subset data is to find out how much data there is and exactly
 * divide it among the parts. For example, if there are 100 data points and 10
 * tests, give task 0 gets data values 0-9, task 1 values 10-19, etc. This type
 * of division is easy to do with random access data (as are other convenient
 * strategies), but not always feasible in other container types.
 * 
 * Concretely, the quad-tree containers don't impose a full ordering on the data
 * set. So providing and index into the data isn't convenient. However, it is
 * discrete at the level of leaf-quads. Similarly, the Avro serialization format
 * provides segments, but not random-access to those segments. The data can
 * still be divided, but providing the level of control over what falls into which
 * division random access structures provide is expensive and unnecessary. 
 * The segment system provides a vocabulary for specifying data subsets without implying precision.
 * 
 * 
 * Random Access
 * -------------
 * A particularly common way to support segmentation is to support random access.
 * When random access is present, a number of additional classes for segmentation
 * can be used.
 * 
 * @param <I> The type of the information associated with a glyph entry.
