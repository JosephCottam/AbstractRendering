/** Store of aggregate values.
 * 
 * Aggregates are the results of rendering geometry into a bin.  They are
 * the core unique conceptual data structure of Abstract Rendering.  In
 * essence, a set of aggregates is a data space derived from a source
 * data space and a set of geometry.  (The source data and geometry
 * are provided via Glyphsets).  
 * 
 * Aggregate implementations are required to report the upper and lower end
 * of their bounds so region-based operations can be performed without
 * realizing the entire aggregate space.  Efficient sub-setting
 * is not required of any aggregate sets, only that they accurately
 * report the region that they represent.
 * 
 * The preferred means of creating a set of aggregates is through the
 * AggreagteUtils.make methods.
 * 
 * Note: The current aggregates implementation is based on Cartesian grids
 * (notice how all indexing is done via X/Y).  We are exploring alternative 
 * aggregate arrangements and will be updating this interface to reflect a 
 * more general addressing scheme.
